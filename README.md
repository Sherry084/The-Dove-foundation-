# The-Dove-foundation-
Let me brief you little more about the foundation project if you don’t mind Carlos ….Our youth today doesn’t know where to turn to, they have no place to stay. Some of our youth can’t turn to family or friends. Most of our teens want to work! Our youth are too busy finding a place to lay their head at night.
